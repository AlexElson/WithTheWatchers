*Feel the impact of every brutal strike in combat - Target individual body parts, such as the eyes or the upper right arm, and hope your enemies don't get a lucky shot. Bleed, faint, even hold your breath; hit points don't determine death.

*Stab, bash, and throw a variety of weapons ranging from knives, wrenches, and even playing cards.

*Multiple endings force you to make difficult decisions.

*Includes a homemade soundtrack.
