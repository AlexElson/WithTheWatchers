# WithTheWatchers (Created in Python/Pygame)
With the Watchers is a story-driven, turn-based isometric strategy game that delves into philosophy and religion.
Advance through dozens of chapters led by a captivating story. Multiple, incredibly varied endings based on your choices throughout the adventure will decide the fate of you, your friends, and even the world.

*Feel the impact of every brutal strike in combat - Target individual body parts, such as the eyes or the upper right arm, and hope your enemies don't get a lucky shot. Bleed, faint, even hold your breath; hit points don't determine death.

*Stab, bash, and throw a variety of weapons ranging from knives, wrenches, and even playing cards.

*Multiple endings force you to make difficult decisions.

*Includes a homemade soundtrack.
